# Formbricks React

Building React forms has never been quicker. With our Formbricks React library we are building an easy to use form library with a lot of different input types build in so it's easier and faster for you to build your form and grow it later.
By using our react library you also automatically comply with best practices in building and rendering forms, reduce number of rerenders compared to HTML-forms in React as well as include best-practices for accessibility into your form.

Under the hood we are using [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) which provides a lot of this awesome functionality.
