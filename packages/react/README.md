# Building React forms just got really easy ü§∏

Every developer works with forms, few like their experience. Building Forms, especially in React, can be pretty annoying. State management, validation, form components, accessibility, internationalization and performance are all things you have to deal with, but don't really want to.

We make building - and maintaining - forms easier than ever in the world of React.

### Example

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Email, Checkbox, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
import "@formbricks/react/styles.css";

export default function WaitlistForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}>
      <Text name="name" label="What's your name?" validation="required" />
      <Email name="email" label="How can we reach you?" validation="email" />
      <Checkbox
        name="terms"
        label="Terms & Conditions"
        help="To use our service, please accept."
        validation="accepted"
      />
      <Submit label="Let's go!" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Why is this easier already?

- One easy to use syntax for all input types
- HTML & non-HTML input types available out of the box
- Easily maintainable with component-based approach
- All characteristics adjustable via props
- Automatic schema generation

### What is to come?

- Conditional logic
- Multi-page forms
- Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Form templates (content & styles)

## Custom Styling (CSS & Tailwind)

Giving your form the right look and feel is very likely why you chose to use code. Formbricks React supports styling with a custom style sheet as well as Tailwind CSS.

### Custom Stylesheet

Simply create a style sheet, import it and add your CSS to these classes:

### Tailwind CSS

We love Tailwind! This is why Formbricks React natively supports Tailwind. All you have to do is target the classes using props. For example, to extend ‚Äúformbricks-outer‚Äù class:

```jsx
<Text name="firstname" label="What's your first name?" outerClassName="bg-gray-800 my-5" />
```

### Overview of props to target CSS classes

Here are all the props you can use to extend the styling of the different form elements:

| CSS class           | Prop              | Content                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| formbricks-form     | formClassName     | The wrapper around the complete form                         |
| formbricks-outer    | outerClassName    | The wrapper around label, input field and help text          |
| formbricks-legend   | legendClassName   | The label of the options group (only radio & checkbox input) |

| formbricks-input    | inputClassName    | The input                                                    |

| formbricks-messages | messagesClassName | Wrapper around all error messages                            |

## Validation & Error Messages

Validation prevents users from submitting missing of false data.

To add a validation to your inputs, add the `validation` prop and write the rules in string syntax. Rules are divided by a pipe (`|`), e.g.:

```jsx
<Text name="age" label="What's your age?" validation="required|number|min:0|max:100" />
```

| Rule     | Explanation                                                                | Example    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| required | Only accepts non-empty fields                                              | ‚Äúrequired‚Äù |
| number   | Only accepts fields with a number or float value                           | ‚Äúnumber‚Äù   |
| min      | Only accepts number values that are greater or equal to the value provided | ‚Äúmin:10‚Äù   |
| max      | Only accepts number values that are greater or equal to the value provided | ‚Äúmax:50‚Äù   |
| accepted | Only accepts a truish value (true or 1)                                    | "accepted" |
| url      | Only accepts URLs e.g. "https://formbricks.com"                            | "url"      |
| email    | Only accepts email addresses                                               | "email"    |
