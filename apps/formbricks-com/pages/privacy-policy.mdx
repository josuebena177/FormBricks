## **1. Introduction**

We take your data privacy serious. It is our highest priority to offer a solution, both self-hosted and in our managed cloud. We take on considerable additional effort to collect as little data as neccessary and handle it safely and securely.

This Privacy Policy explains how and why our organization collects personal data and how it is used. If you have any questions after reading this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at **privacy@formbricks.com**

### Important Notice

This Privacy Policy only applies to the Formbricks Cloud under [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com) (‚ÄùCloud‚Äù) and our Landing Page under formbricks.com. (‚ÄùLanding Page‚Äù) If you are self-hosting our open source tool on your own servers, this Privacy Policy does not apply.
