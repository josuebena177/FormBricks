_Session recordings unveil weakness of current product, new UX approach and positioning in the making. Letâ€™s have a not so close look ðŸ˜‰_

## TLDR

- Working closely with 3 customers
- New UX approach
- Status Quo

## Close collaboration with design partners

Weâ€™re working closely with three customers to get the most insights out of their user base. To understand best what they need, weâ€™re doing a lot of manual PM work to weave user research into their products that complements product analytics.

These collaborations showed us that the current tight focus on Best Practices is not flexibel enough. While the general idea of Best Practices resonates well, the technical approach to exactly one way of implementing them is a limitation. To be more flexible, we're reiterating on the technical approach, while sticking with the messaging ðŸ‘‡

## New UX/DX approach

Based on these insights and the overall feedback of the ProductHunt launch, weâ€™re reitarting a little bit. While the Best Practice messaging works really well (~500 waitlist signups) the technical approach is limiting. They were hardly adjustable so fitting them to the specific needs of our customers caused quite some technical overhead.

### Do less while doing more

Initially, we built a Feedback Box widget and a separate PMF Survey widget. We also built custom dashboards for each survey type. Maintaining both slowed us down and with the Onboarding Survey and Interview Prompt coming up next, we would keep adding to the complexity and move slower with every Best Practice.

Also, the developer experience wasnâ€™t great. Users had to embed the widgets separately, trigger them separately, etc. This has to be much smoother, easier. After all, the best DX is copy + pasting a code snippet and forgetting about it.

Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re building now. A universal widget. A universal dashboard. A solid basis to experiment with.

### Whats happening with Best Practices?

<Image src={BestPractices} alt="Best Practices" className="rounded-lg" />

The Best Practice approach is really popular and resonates well. Weâ€™re evaluating different options on how we can bring these specific use cases onto the Formbricks platform. As a truly open-source forms and survey platform, a WordPress-like App Store could be cool. This would have lots of benefits:

- Users can add specific functionality as they need it. It doesnâ€™t make sense to clutter the UI with 50 different form and survey use cases, if you only need 3.
- The community can build custom plugins to add functionality they need. Think about custom UIs for in-app surveys, managing industry-specific responses, custom exports, integrations, etc.
- Specific functionality (e.g. like managing 1:1 interviews with an auto-interview scheduler) could live in itâ€™s own space instead of being dragged through the whole product from the start.

Such an app store is certainly something for the medium-term. However, weâ€™re excited about the prospect of housing a large variety of in-app survey needs while keeping the core product fast and nimble.

## Status Quo

Weâ€™ve sketched out the UI, sorted all features for the next and subsequent version and dove in building it out. While we have most of the pieces ready, some might take a couple of days to build (e.g. setting up events inside the Formbricks interface to trigger in-product surveys).

Really cool stuff coming up, stay tuned!
