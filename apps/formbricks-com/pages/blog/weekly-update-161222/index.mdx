_Happy Friday! Another week is over, another YC interview done 😄 We decided to niche down, found two design partners and with them secured the first MRR. What happened exactly?_

### Highlights

- Niching down: Building Feedback Box first
- $100 MRR for collaboration with two SaaS companies 🎉
- Second YC Interview

### Niching down: The Feedback Box

Next week we’ll release a longer article on our journey from “Typeform OS” to “Modular Form & Survey Infrastructure” to “Survey needs of SaaS companies”. For now, let’s have a look at the mock-up of the Feedback Box we are building:

### First two customers acquired, first MRR 🎉

We acquired two SaaS companies as customers with a set of different survey needs. The overall objective is to open up and maintain a continuous channel to learn from users. Both are in need of a conversion-optimized Feedback widget they can self-host. Here were the requirements and how we address themthem:

- Very little dev attention needed for setup and maintenance

  **→ One snippet to embed**

- Gives respondents the feeling that they are listened to and the feedback is acted upon

  **→ Founder / Head of Product as recipient**

- Makes users reply in a polite way

  **→ Highlighting that there are people on the other end**

- Have users share positive feedback to be used as testimonial (and increase team morale)

  **→ “I like something” option**

- Easy to act upon

  **→ One click to email back with template, later integration with Linear / GitHub issues**

### 2nd YC Interview

On Tuesday night we had our second YC interview. This time, we didn’t prepare too much and it went similar to the last one: It was a friendly chat about what we are building and why.

We haven’t yet heared back from them, you’ll hear about the decision in the next Weekly 😃

### Until then, enjoy your weekend!
