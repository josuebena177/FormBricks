## New Onboarding Survey embedded in Formbricks

We are staying true to our approach to using Formbricks and our best practices in Formbricks itself to learn more about our users and how to build the best possible product for them.
This week, we embedded an onboarding survey that gives us insights about every user who signs up for Formbricks and notifies us in our team's Slack workspace.

## New integration survey to learn what to build next

The next big step for Formbricks is to make it fit perfectly into your existing technology and analytics stack. So you can integrate Corhorts and analytics data from Posthog, enrich it with results from targeted micro-surveys you run with Formbricks, and sync your customers with Hubspot to optimize your sales process.
To learn what tools our customers are using and what integrations we need to build first, we are building an inline survey in the integrations tab in Formbricks. The results are neatly summarized by Formbricks and also sent to our team's Slack workspace.

## See Formbricks in action before you buy

We want to show our users the power of Formbricks before they start a survey on their own. That‚Äôs why this week we have built a demo dashboard that shows you what a Product Market Fit survey in Formbricks looks like and allows you to play with the data and draw conclusions and actions for this fictional case. You can play around with the demo dashboard at [https://app.formbricks.com/demo](https://app.formbricks.com/demo)

## New docs are online

We have rewritten our docs to help our users embed Formbricks into their apps step by step. Formbricks supports all major frontends with it's simple javascript widgets, but also lets you customize it the way you want. Check out our new documentation at [https://formbricks.com/docs](https://formbricks.com/docs)

## What's next?

In the last two weeks we have come a long way in finishing Formbricks and we are ready to onboard more users. Next week we will be onboarding most of our current waitlist subscribers to the Product Market Fit survey. It has been a long journey to get here and we are very excited to show the world what they can do with the new Formbricks.

## Enjoy your weekends! üç∞
