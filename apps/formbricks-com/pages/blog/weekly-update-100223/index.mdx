## New Onboarding Survey embedded in Formbricks

We are staying true to our approach to using Formbricks to learn more about our users.
This week, we embedded an Onboarding Survey that gives us insights about every user who signs up to Formbricks and surfaces these insights us in our team's Slack workspace.

## New inline survey to learn what integration to build first

One of the next big steps for Formbricks is to make it fit perfectly into existing tech and analytics stack. It should be possible to import user corhorts and other analytics data from tools like Posthog, enrich it with results from targeted micro-surveys you run with Formbricks, and sync your user profile with Hubspot to optimize your sales process.
To learn what tools our customers are using and what integrations we need to build first, we built an inline survey in the integrations tab. The results are neatly summarized by Formbricks and also sent to our team's Slack workspace.

## See Formbricks in action before you buy

We want to show our users the power of Formbricks before they start a survey on their own. That‚Äôs why this week we have built a demo dashboard that shows you what a Product Market Fit survey in Formbricks looks like and allows you to play with the data and draw conclusions and actions for this fictional case. You can play around with the demo dashboard at [https://app.formbricks.com/demo](https://app.formbricks.com/demo)

## New docs are online

We have rewritten our docs to help users embed Formbricks into their apps. Formbricks supports all major frontends with it's plain javascript widgets, but also supports customization. Check out our new documentation at [https://formbricks.com/docs](https://formbricks.com/docs)

## What's next?

In the last two weeks we have come a long way in polishing Formbricks and we are ready to onboard more users. Next week we will be onboarding most of our current waitlist subscribers to the Product Market Fit survey - we are super excited to gather more feedback on the current product.

## Enjoy your weekends! üç∞
