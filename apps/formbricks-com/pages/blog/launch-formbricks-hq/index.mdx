_Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of Formbricks HQ, the newest addition to our suite of open source survey tools! Formbricks HQ is an easy-to-use product that allows developers to quickly and easily create, manage, and deploy forms for their websites, without the need for a server._

### What can you use it for?

In our last [Weekly Update](/blog/weekly-update-021222), we already shared the use case of polling users natively in your app or webshop and showing them the results right away.

## Use case: Native NPS survey

To showcase the power of Formbricks HQ, we built another common use case: The NPS survey. We used Formbricks React to build the survey natively into our example app. When the survey is submitted, the data is sent to Formbricks HQ and displayed.

### Step 1: Create NPS survey in Formbricks HQ

With a few clicks you create a new form in Formbricks HQ:

<Image src={API} alt="Polling users natively in-app" className="rounded-lg" />

### Step 2: Using Formbricks React to build the survey

We built the NPS survey with Formbricks React. It is a simple form with two questions and a submit button. The form is built with the following code:

```jsx
import { Form, Nps, sendToHq, Submit, Textarea } from "@formbricks/react";

<Form formId="clbfbfqjh0000jz0803qh43y8" customerId="yourcustomer@company.com" onSubmit={sendToHq}>
  <Nps name="nps" label="How likely are you to recommend Formbricks to a friend or colleague?" />
  <Textarea name="feedback" label="Your feedback" cols={30} />
  <Submit label="Submit" />
</Form>;
```

<Image src={NPS1} alt="NPS natively embedded into app" className="rounded-lg" />

From the HQ you can copy the endpoint to your form action. The endpoint is a POST request which accepts JSON data. The data is then sent to your personal endpoint hosted on Formbricks HQ.

### Step 3: Displaying the results

The results are displayed in the HQ dashboard. You can see the results in real-time. The dashboard is built with [Formbricks Charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formbricks/charts) and uses the same schema as [Formbricks React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formbricks/react).

<Image src={NPS2} alt="Results summary" className="rounded-lg" />

<Image src={NPS3} alt="Results overview" className="rounded-lg" />

### What is a schema good for?

The cool thing - apart from you being able to self-host and customize the complete solution - is that Frombricks React and HQ are using the same schema.

Weâ€™ve wrote about the [benefit in-depth in our Docs](/docs/formbricks-hq/schema), but here is the benefit in a nutshell:

You get a full image of the survey data including questions and not selected options. Without a schema, your stuck with the data which is sent along so the selected value and the input label. Here is the difference:

<Image src={NoSchema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />
<Image src={Schema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />

And just like that you have a native NPS survey with full data insights! ðŸš€

## What else can you use Formbricks HQ for?

Apart from the use case above, you can send any form data to your personal endpoint. Here is a short tutorial on how to do that, [the full guide is in our docs](/docs/react-form-library/link-formbricks-hq):

1. Sign up at [hq.formbricks.com](http://hq.formbricks.com)
2. Create a new form
3. Copy the endpoint to your form action
4. Receive responses
