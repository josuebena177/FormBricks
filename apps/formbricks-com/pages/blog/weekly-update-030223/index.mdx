## TLDR:

- New customer (first one via waitlist) → $1.800 ARR 🎉
- Self-serving PMF survey 🏗️
  - Landing Page
  - Onboarding segmentation survey
  - Payment embedded
  - Bug fixing
- Dogfooding Formbricks 🐶
- Feedback Box in production on question-aid.com 🤓

## First customer via waitlist → $1.800 ARR 🎉

We are currently not promoting the landing page. Nonetheless, we have several people per day filling out our waitlist survey (189 in 2 weeks).

Yesterday, the first person bought the Early Bird subscription after filling out the form:

## Self-serve PMF survey 🏗️

While onboarding people for the PMF survey, we noticed the following:

- The setup still required a lot of manual support which was a lot harder to provide for non-open source companies (couldn’t access code ourselves, long time to production)
- Prospects required some material to share within the team to assess if Formbricks adds value
- Some were slow to book the onboarding call, requested self-serve

This is why we decided to improve the self-serve experience.

### Funnel Design Considerations

This is how we plan to build an effective funnel:

1. **Shortest way to experience value**
   1. Live demo with dummy data
   2. Video walk-through to provide more context (native embedding, open source)
2. **Try tech before you buy + validation**
   1. Feedback Widget is free to implement and use
   2. Hard paywall for PMF survey (value experienceable in Demo)
3. **Buying pressure**
   1. 50% off for first year for first 20 buyers
   2. Waitlist members can get in a day before everyone else

###

### What we have built so far

✅ Landing Page for PMF survey (to be released)

✅ Onboarding segmentation (frontend)

✅ Added payment to app

##

### What we'll build next week

▶️ Launch live demo with dummy data

▶️ Add video walk-through

▶️ Write docs

▶️ In-app inline survey (Integrations)

## Dogfooding Formbricks 🐶

<Image src={Eating} alt="Eating Dogfood" className="rounded-lg" />

With the launch of the waitlist we started using Formbricks on a daily basis. So far, from a UX perspective, it’s a pretty standard survey data dashboard: Look at individual responses or aggregated views. Obviously, we aren’t done here.

### Building Formbricks into Formbricks

All respondents of the waitlist are fed into a database of users. For each user we create a profile where we gather all additional qualitative data points…

<Image quality={100} src={UserView} alt="Stripe Screenshot" className="rounded-lg" />

… like the reponses of the onboarding survey:

<Callout title="Data-driven" type="note">
  Over 50% of waitlist respondents (n=189) requested Onboarding Segmentation. We’re building it into
  Formbricks to gather more qualitative user data and show users what it could look like in their products 👀
</Callout>

Additionally, we survey users as they explore the product:

<Image src={Integrations} alt="Stripe Screenshot" className="rounded-lg" />

Together with the usage data from PostHog we get a very good understanding of how **and - most importantly - why** users came to try out Formbricks.

Spinning up and implementing these surveys is quick and easy. It is a great way to survey users contextualized to the product experience. Especially in larger products, well-positioned micro-surveys are another powerful tool in the belt of product managers.

### Working with the user view

And the best part? Once we’ve released an integration, we can filter our user base according to their answers and communicate highly targeted.

For products with a larger user base and a more comprehensive set of tools, you can pipe the micro-survey responses to HubSpot / [customer.io](http://customer.io). This allows you to approach current and churned users in a much more granular way because you understand them better.

## Feedback Box spotted in the wild 🤓

We spotted another Feedback Box in the wild at [question-aid.com](https://question-aid.com)
