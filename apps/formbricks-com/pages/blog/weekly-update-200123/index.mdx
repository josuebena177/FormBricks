_We‚Äôve been üö¢ing: Big landing page update, new survey engine, PMF prototype in the making. Let‚Äôs have a closer look at what we worked on this week üëá_

### TLDR

- Big update on the landing page to reflect niching down
- Survey engine v0.1
- New validation approach implemented, waitlist built
- PMF survey prototyped

## Landing Page Update

We‚Äôve talked about niching down in our Weekly for some time already, but it wasn‚Äôt reflected on the landing page. As we are reaching out to more and more potential design partners, we revamped the landing page. Most obvious changes:

- Directly address pains and gains of target audience
- Removed everything related to ‚ÄúOpen source Form and Survey Infrastructure‚Äù
- Added Waitlist survey (built with survey engine)

_Addressing technical founders and growth engineers._

## New validation approach

Instead of making our prototypes available to the public we decided to add a layer of friction. It doesn‚Äôt help us when people create an account, click around and never come back.

Instead, we‚Äôre going into a deeper conversation with users who fit our target persona - and ask everyone else to hold out until we‚Äôve built a product which provides substatial value for a small set of users. What does it mean in practice?

_If they don‚Äôt fill out this survey, they don‚Äôt have a pressing problem._

In practice this means that we took down the public sign up and added a waitlist survey. The waitlist contains quite a few questions which is intentional: If people are not willing to take 5 minutes to answer a few questions, they are unlikely to take up with the additional time and attention of being a design partner. Only if they have a pressing problem, we should take their feedback into account.

## Survey engine v0.1

We‚Äôve developed an engine which can generate surveys based on a schema. This engine will be the technical foundation for all upcoming surveys. It allows us to:

- Decouple the content of the surveys from the user interface in which they are shown. We can standardize the survey content in our backend and stay flexible on how customers want to put the surveys in front of their users.
- Later on, we can rather quickly build a visual survey builder to manipulate the schema. This way, customers can change survey content in the Formbricks dashboard instead of having to dive into their frontend code.

```tsx
{
    id: "rolePage",
    config: {
      autoSubmit: true,
    },
    elements: [
      {
        id: "role",
        type: "radio",
        label: "How would you describe your role?",
        name: "role",
        options: [
          { label: "Founder", value: "founder", frontend: { icon: FounderIcon } },
          {
            label: "Product Manager",
            value: "productManager",
            frontend: { icon: LaptopWorkerIcon },
          },
          { label: "Engineer", value: "engineer", frontend: { icon: EngineerIcon } },
        ],
        component: IconRadio,
      },
    ],
  },
```

### PMF Prototype in the making

With the new survey engine at hand, we‚Äôre proceeding to building the first proper survey. We‚Äôll focus on the Superhuman PMF survey as a lot of SaaS founder ran it in the past with a subpar experience.

The survey is built quick. Getting that native look & feel with the product will require some investigation. We haven‚Äôt yet determined the right balance between custom frontend code built by the user and easy implementation of prestyled components.

_Most founders email out their surveys. We focus on delivering a 10x better conversion rate to get people to try out Formbricks._
