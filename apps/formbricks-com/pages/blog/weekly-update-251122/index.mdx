# Product

### Launched Formbricks React Library ü•≥

We launched v0.1 and v0.2 of the Formbricks React Library.

- **Why?** Make it as easy as possible to build forms in React
- **How?** Offering all essential form functionality out of the box
- **What?** Lots of input components, validation, easy styling, easy multi-step forms, i18n, a11y and everything else you need when building forms in React.

Have a look at this example:

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Email, Checkbox, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
import "@formbricks/react/styles.css";

export default function WaitlistForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}>
      <Text name="name" label="What's your name?" validation="required" />
      <Email
        name="email"
        label="What's your email address?"
        placeholder="you@example.com"
        validation="required|email"
      />
      <Checkbox
        name="terms"
        label="Terms & Conditions"
        help="To use our service, please accept."
        validation="accepted"
      />
      <Submit label="Let's go!" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

A lot more information in the [Docs, check them out!](/docs/react-form-library/introduction)

### What's next for Formbricks React?

In the upcoming week we're not planning to add more features to it. We'll first ship a version of the Formbricks HQ to offer an end-to-end solution from form creation to submission handling to analysis üëá

## Formbricks HQ Demo

With the YC interview coming up next week, we decided to build an end-to-end demo. We're not focussing on production readiness for now. Expect to get your fingers on it the week after!

## Feedback tool for the State of Geneva, Switzerland

We were delighted to find out that a digital agency built a POC for a feedback functionality in an e-learning offer from the state of Geneva, Switzerland.

In the call we learned a lot about why they chose snoopForms (privacy-first), how their developer experience has been (pretty good) and what they need in the future.

They are working on a more comprehensive offer for forms & surveys for the Swiss market built on top of Formbricks!

So exciting for us to see that our product and positioning resonates so well üòä

# Community

Shoutout to octalpixel and Akshu from the EddieHub community for sharing feedback on the React Library. Highly appreciated üôè

## Listmonk

We chose [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) as our Newsletter tool as it is a promising open-source option. So far the setup has been pretty good!

You can sign up to our "Build in Public" list at the bottom of this article to not miss a single one of them üòâ

## YC Interview

We got invited! This is obviously very exciting so we spent some time getting our answers crisp. We're talking some alumns to learn from their experience ü§û

## Have a great weekend!
