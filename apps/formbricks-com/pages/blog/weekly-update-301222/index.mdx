## Feedback Box in Vanilla JS

We first built the Feedback Box in React (as seen in the video) and then rebuilt it in plain JavaScript. We ran several tests and are currently working on the customizable config for colors, contact person and CTAs before we deploy it.

## Prototyping Formbricks XM

We forked the Formbricks HQ to facilitate the product changes needed for an opinionated XM solution for SaaS startups. This is the first draft of the dashboard to manage user feedback:

<Image src={FXM} alt="Experience Management for SaaS" className="rounded-lg" />

So far, the meta data you get is:

- Category: Idea, Love, Bug
- Time of Feedback
- User incl. Email / uuid
- Device Info
- Page

And you can act on it by:

- Sending an email (simple mailto: link)
- Archive

A key insight from user interviews is that the feedback shared with the founders or product team is **always the starting point of a deeper conversation**. To facilitate that we can build category-specific actions:

- Idea / Love: Issuing an in-app interview prompt to schedule a time for this specific user
- Bug: Linear and GitHub projects integrations
- Bug: Integration to open support ticket
- Love: Prepare testimonial for quick share on Social / Landing Page
- All: Templates to reply faster
- All: Segment Integration to enrich user profiles

<Image src={CXM} alt="Customer Overview" className="rounded-lg" />

The feedback box allows to send along as much meta data as you need. Doing so, it‚Äôs possible to build up a customer profile over all micro-survey touchpoints in the SaaS app.

<Image src={CDetail} alt="Customer Detail View Open Source Hotjar" className="rounded-lg" />

Over time, the properties in the user profiles can be used to create cohorts for contextualized micro-interactions like 1-on-1 interview prompts, handing out SWAG or Product-Market-Fit surveys.

## Influenza and test setups

Unfortunately we have not been spared from an influenza infection, which slowed us down a bit. We took the time to look at the hypotheses we‚Äôre building the experience management solution for SaaS startups on. Here are the critical ones:

- **Problem Risk:** SaaS founders recognize that they don‚Äôt know enough about their users
- **Value Risk:** SaaS founders see the value of a systematic, productized approach for continuous in-app discovery and are willing to pay for it
- **Feasibility Risk:** Even with a small amount of responses we can create sufficient value to keep founders from churning out of Formbricks after a few months
- **Solution Fit:** Natively embedded surveys drive higher conversion than ‚Äúbottom right pop-ups‚Äù

### Current status of validation

- **Problem Risk** üü¢ **-** Based on our own experience, 11 interviews with the target group and extensive desk research we can say: The majority of SaaS operators know that they don‚Äôt know enough about their users.
- **Value Risk** üî¥ **-** Even though we have two paying customers it is too early to assess. To build more conviction we‚Äôll setup a landing page with a waitlist survey. We‚Äôll also go into direct sales to find 8 more beta users to pay $49 / month.
- **Feasibility Risk** üî¥ **-** We‚Äôre building the prototype right now. Once implemented we will go through a few iterations before we can assess if Formbricks XM provides value for 200 WAUs and up.
- **Solution Fit** üü† **-** On average, in-app surveys convert 6x higher than standalone surveys. However, we do not know yet how natively embedded (inline) surveys perform in comparison.

To gather sufficient data we‚Äôre employing a mix of pretotyping (landing page + waitlist survey), prototyping (with customers) and user interviews.
