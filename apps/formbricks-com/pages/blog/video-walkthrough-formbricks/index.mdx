_The new, powerful Formbricks is almost ready!_

<Image src={FormbricksSneak} alt="Sneakpeek into what the new Formbricks can do" className="rounded-lg" />

We've been working hard on getting a revamped Formbricks ready - we're almost there!

What you can do with it:

1. Design **any survey** you want
2. Trigger at any point in your app both **No Code** (page view, element click) and **Code** (hook `formbricks.track` into your event)
3. Pass custom user attributes to Formbricks to **segment your user base**

## Have a look:

  allowFullScreen
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Formbricks is a lot more powerful than ever before! :mechanical_arm:

You can create:

- Onboarding surveys,
- PMF surveys,
- Churn surveys,
- Feature chaser,
- Feedback box,
- Identify customer goals,
- Measure task completion,
- etc, etc.

## Stay tuned, Formbricks Cloud goes live soon!
