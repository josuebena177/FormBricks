_Submission tagging, user actions and work on universal widget. Let's have a closer look:_

<Image src={HeaderImage} alt="Weekly Update" className="rounded-lg" />

## TLDR:

- Submission tagging
- User actions
- Universal widget

## Submission tagging

Early user requested a better way to organize submissions. You can now tag submissions and filter accordingly. This is useful if you want to group submissions by a certain attribute:

<Image src={Tagging} quality={100} alt="Submission Tagging" className="rounded-lg" />

## User actions

To keep your user base tidy, you can now delete users. Additionally, you can send them an email with the click of a button.

As soon as we have built the in-app interview prompt, you can invitie single users to take part in a 1:1 interview via an in-app prompt.

<Image src={UserActions} quality={100} alt="User Actions" className="rounded-lg" />

We're currently working on a universal widget to create any kind of in-app survey. This allows us to cater to more use cases and provide a more flexible solution.
