The Feedback Box gives your users a direct channel to share their feedback and feel heard.

## Purpose

A low friction way to gather feedback helps catching even the smallest points of frustration in user experiences. Use automations to react rapidly and make users feel heard.

## Preview

<DemoPreview template="Feedback Box" />

## Formbricks Approach

- Make it easy: 2 clicks to share feedback
- Pipe insights where team can see them and react quickly

## Installation

To add the Feedback Box to your app, you need to perform these steps:

1. Create new Feedback Box at app.formbricks.com
2. Add user action to trigger Feedback Box
3. Update recontact settings to display correctly

### 1. Create new Feedback Box

If you don't have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)

Then, create a new survey and look for the "Feedback Box" template:

<Image src={CreateFeedbackBox} alt="Create feedback box by template" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

### 2. Update question content

Change the questions and answer options according to your preference:

<Image src={ChangeTextContent} alt="Change text content" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

### 3. Create user action to trigger Feedback Box:

Go to the ‚ÄúAudience‚Äù tab, find the ‚ÄúWhen to send‚Äù card and choose ‚ÄúAdd Action‚Äù. We will now use our super cool No-Code User Action Tracker:

<Image src={AddAction} alt="Add action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

<Callout title="You can also add actions in your code" type="note">
  You can also create [Code Actions](/docs/actions/code) using `formbricks.track("Eventname")` - they will
  automatically appear in your Actions overview as long as the SDK is embedded.
</Callout>

We have two options to track the Feedback Button in your application: innerText and CSS-Selector:

1. **innerText:** This means that whenever a user clicks any HTML item in your app which has an `innerText` of `Feedback` the Feedback Box will be displayed.
2. **CSS-Selector:** This means that when an element with a specific CSS-Selector like `#feedback-button` is clicked, your Feedback Box is triggered.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 space-x-2">
  <Image src={AddHTMLAction} alt="Add HTML action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />
  <Image src={AddCSSAction} alt="Add CSS action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />
</div>

### 4. Select action in the ‚ÄúWhen to ask‚Äù card

<Image src={SelectAction} alt="Select feedback button action" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

### 5. Set Recontact Options correctly

Scroll down to ‚ÄúRecontact Options‚Äù. Here you have to choose the right settings so that the Feedback Box pops up every time the user action is performed. (Our default is that every user sees every survey only once):

<Image src={RecontactOptions} alt="Set recontact options" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

### 7. You‚Äôre ready publish your survey!

<Image src={PublishSurvey} alt="Publish survey" quality="100" className="rounded-lg" />

## Setting up the Widget

<Callout title="Formbricks Widget running?" type="warning">
  You need to have the Formbricks Widget installed to display the Feedback Box in your app. Please follow
  [this tutorial (Step 4 onwards)](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to install the widget.
</Callout>
