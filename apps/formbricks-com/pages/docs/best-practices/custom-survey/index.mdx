<Callout title="Visual Form Builder in progress" type="note">
  We're working on a visual form builder so that you can create custom forms within Formbricks. Sign up now to
  stay in the loop!
</Callout>

## Purpose

Build custom forms without the backend: Use Formbricks to gather and analyze form submissions. Pipe the data where you need it.

## Formbricks Approach

- Custom forms allow 100% customizability (duh!)
- Use Formbricks backend as endpoint
- Use Formbricks Data Pipelines to forward data where you need it.

## Creating and updating a submission via HTML form

This is an example on how to create a new submission with an HTML form:

```jsx
<form action="https://app.formbricks.com/api/capture/forms/{formId}/submissions" method="post">
```

If you want to update a submission, you can also do that:

```jsx
<form action="https://app.formbricks.com/api/capture/forms/{formId}/submissions/{submissionId}" method="post">
```

## API docs

To change a submission or schema, you'll need an API key. Please refer to our [API documentation](/docs/api/setup).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
