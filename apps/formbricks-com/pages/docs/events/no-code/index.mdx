  title: "No-Code Events",
};

No-Code events can be set up within Formbricks with just a few clicks. There are three types of No-Code events:

## Page URL Event

The page URL event is triggered, when a user visits a specific page in your application. There are several match conditions:

- `exactMatch`: The URL should exactly match the provided string.
- `contains`: The URL should contain the specified string as a substring.
- `startsWith`: The URL should start with the specified string.
- `endsWith`: The URL should end with the specified string.
- `notMatch`: The URL should not match the specified condition.
- `notContains`: The URL should not contain the specified string as a substring.

## innerText Event (coming soon)

The innerText event checks if the `innerText` of a clicked HTML element matches a specific text, e.g. the label of a button.

## CSS Selector Event (coming soon)

The CSS Selector event checks if the provided CSS selector matches the selector of a clicked HTML element. The CSS selector can be a class, id or any other CSS selector within your website.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
