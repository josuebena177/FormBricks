export const meta = {
  title: "What are events and why are they useful?",
};

You want to understand what your users think and feel during specific moments in the user journey. To be able to ask at exactly the right point in time, you need events.

## What are events?

Events are a little notification sent from your application to Formbricks. You decide which events are sent either in your [Code](/docs/events/code) or by setting up a [No-Code](/docs/events/no-code) event within Formbricks.

## How do events work?

When a predefined event happens in your app, the Formbricks widget notices. This event can then trigger a survey to be shown to the user and is stored in the database.

## Why are events useful?

Events help you to display your surveys at the right time. Later on, you will be able to segment your users based on the events they have triggered in the past. This way, you can create much more granular user segments, e.g. only target users that already have used a specific feature.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
