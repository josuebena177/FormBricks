With all the form tools out there, why would we build another one?

## Why though?

It doesn't matter what products we've built over the past couple of years, forms always played an important role. While there are great solutions out there, you very quickly reach the barrier of what's possible. They all do one thing well, but when it comes to leveraging qualitative data, one thing isn't enough.

Over time, this leads to a collection of island solutions in different teams as well as creative approaches to hack form functionality together. Data is scattered everywhere, maintenance is costly and valuable insights are not used to their full potential.

### Forms bridge ğŸ§  and ğŸ’»

Until Elon ships the Neuralink brain-machine interface, forms are our best bet to get information out of brains into computers. In a business context, a ğŸ§  is either a customer or an employee. The interface to these very important stakeholders should run as smoothly as possible, almost as if it was built on one platform ğŸ˜‰

### Stop rewriting existing code

A common idea is to just "build it ourselves". Forms and surveys appear to be quick to build but once you get started you notice that it gets complicated quickly. Validation, spam protection, data pipelines into different databases and 3rd party services, schemas or supported data analysis are just a few of the things you want, but don't want to build yourself. And you shouldn't, someone already wrote that code, you just cannot use it. This is changing with Formbricks.

### The last form tool

The goal is clear: Build the last form tool humanity needs. But how?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
