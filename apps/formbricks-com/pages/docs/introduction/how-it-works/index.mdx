Formbricks has two sides: The end-user facing surveys and the analysis dashboards.

## End-user facing surveys

The surveys are also split up in two elements: The content and the wrapper.

While you will be able to freely design your surveys later on, we start with Best Practices of managing user experiences.

### Best Practices

Best Practices are more than mere survey templates. They are end-to-end productized methods for managing product. It’s designed like that to make product-led growth easier.

### Wrappers

Wrappers are different ways to put surveys in front of your users: In-app pop-ups, inline surveys, email surveys, standalone surveys with a link to share, etc.

## Analysis Dashboards

The dashboards are specifically designed for each Best Practice. Instead of a generic visualisation of aggregated data we focus on enabling acting on insights. A few examples:

**Feedback Box dashboard:** Built for a quick and individualized reaction on Feedback

**Product-Market Fit dashboard:** Designed to build conviction for upcoming product decisions.

**Interview Prompt dashboard:** Designed to schedule and manage 1:1 interviews with users
