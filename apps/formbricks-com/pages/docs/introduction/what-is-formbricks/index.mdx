On a high-level, form functionality can be divided into five groups: Form creation, usage analytics, data handling, data insights and data actions. Over time, we will offer solution bricks for each of these groups.

### Form Creation Bricks

There are two ways to create a form: Code and No Code. We will empower you to create forms both ways as well as hybrid (start with Code, update with No Code).

We're kicking it off with a [Library for React.js](/react-form-library) and follow up with a fully compatible No Code builder. Your engineers will fly through form creation and can embed them natively into the product, while your operations teams can control the content of the form. Finally, no more Jira tickets to fix a typo.

### Usage Analytics

You want to know how respondents interact with your form or survey. How many complete the survey? Where do they drop-off? What combination of questions works best? We'll provide key insights natively and allow you to hook up your favorite product analytics tool (i.e. [PostHog](https://posthog.com)).

### Data Handling Bricks

Creating a form is only the first step. You need a destination for your submissions. We offer an [API endpoint](/core-api) where you can submit your pre-existing forms to. Within minutes you can start receiving submissions and view them in your [dashboard](/formbricks-hq).

Additionally, we're offering [email notifications](/email), [webhooks](/webhooks) and integrations into all the great tools you're already using. Control the flow of your qualitative data in one place.

### Data Insight Bricks

To get the most out of your qualitative data, you will perform an in-depth analysis of your submissions. While we are busy building out the core tech, we enable you to view and export data as easily as possible. Down the line, assisting in the data analysis is where the magic happens ğŸ§š

### Data Action Bricks

Similarily, you want to act on the qualitative insights about your customer or employee relationship. While you can partially do that with 3rd party tools, you gain real leverage when the flow from form creation to submission analysis to action is integrated intelligently.

Imagine your form tool knows a customers shopping history, the previous NPS rating and understands the sentiment of the micro-survey this customer just filled out on your webshop. It can automatically send out a contextualized voucher for a product the customer is likely to buy. But let's not spill the beans here :)
