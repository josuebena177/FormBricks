## Auth: Personal API key

The API requests are authorized with a personal API key. This API key gives you the same rights as if you were logged in at formbricks.com - **don't share it around!**

### How to generate an API key

1. Go to your profile at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/app/me/settings).
2. Select “Add key”.
3. Label it (this is just for you).
4. Copy the key. You won’t be able to see it again.

<Callout title="Store API key safely" type="warning">
  Anyone who has your API key has full control over your account. For security reasons, you cannot view the
  API key again.
</Callout>

### Delete a personal API key

1. Go to your profile at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/app/me/settings).
2. Find the key you wish to revoke and select “Delete”.
3. Your API key will stop working immediately.
