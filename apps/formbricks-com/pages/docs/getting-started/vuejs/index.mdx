# Setting up Formbricks SDK with Vue.js

In this guide, we will go through the steps to set up the Formbricks SDK in a Vue.js application. This will allow you to create and customize in-product micro-surveys to gather valuable feedback from your users and improve your product experience.

## Introduction

Integrating the Formbricks SDK with Vue.js is a straightforward process. We will make sure the SDK is only loaded and used on the client side, as it's not intended for server-side usage.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. A Vue.js application set up and ready to go.
2. A Formbricks account with an `environmentId` and `apiHost` for your application. You can find these in the Setup Checklist in the Settings.

## Installation

To get started, install the Formbricks SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install --save @formbricks/js
# or
yarn add @formbricks/js
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

## Integration

1. Create a new file called \`formbricks.js\` inside the \`src\` folder of your Vue.js application, and add the following code to initialize the Formbricks SDK:

```javascript
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  formbricks.init({
    environmentId: "your-environment-id",
    apiHost: "your-api-host",
  });
}

export default formbricks;
```

2. In your main.js or main.ts file, import the formbricks.js module:

```javascript
import formbricks from "@/formbricks";
```

3. To make sure Formbricks SDK registers every page change in your Vue.js application, add a global navigation guard to your Vue Router configuration:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import VueRouter from "vue-router";

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const router = new VueRouter({
  // Your router configuration here
});

// Add a global navigation guard
router.afterEach((to, from) => {
  if (typeof formbricks !== "undefined") {
    formbricks.registerRouteChange();
  }
});
```

Now, the Formbricks SDK is set up and ready to use in your Vue.js application. You can start creating and customizing in-product micro-surveys for your users.
