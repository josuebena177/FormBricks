You can send your form and survey data to a destination of your choice via a Webhook. To do so you can set up a Webhook Pipeline in your form settings.

## Send form data with Webhook

### Setup

You need to have a form created to add a data pipeline to it.

### Step 1: Add Pipeline

In the top bar, select “Pipelines”. Click on “Add Pipeline” in the top right corner:

### Step 2: Select type of Pipeline

Select Webhook. You can also set up an [Email Notification](/docs/formbricks-hq/ui/email-notifications).

### Step 3: Configure settings

To setup your Webhook you need to fill out three fields:

**Webhook label:** Give it a name to know what this is for.

**Endpoint URL:** Copy your endpoint URL here. This is where the webhook sends the form data to.

**Secret**: To authenticate the data transmission, add a secret. You can generate one [here](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator) or just type something in.

Then select “Create”.

### Step 4: Make sure it’s active

Congrats, you have created your webhook pipeline! Make sure it is set to “**Active**”.

/>

From now on the webhook will be triggered whenever someone submits your form. All form data will be sent to the
destination.

To deactive it, just turn it off. You can also delete it anytime.
