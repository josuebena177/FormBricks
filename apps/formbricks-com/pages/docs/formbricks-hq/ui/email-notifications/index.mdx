You can send your form and survey data to your email address. To do so you can setup an Email Pipeline in your form settings.

## Send form data to email

### Setup

You need to have a form created to add a data pipeline to it.

### Step 1: Add Pipeline

In the top bar, select “Pipelines”. Click on “Add Pipeline” in the top right corner:

### Step 3: Configure settings

To setup your Pipeline you need to fill out two fields:

**Pipeline label:** Give it a name, this is just for you

**Email address:** Type in your email address

Then select “Create”.

### Step 4: Make sure it’s active

Congrats, you have created your email pipeline! Make sure it is set to “**Active**”.

From now on you will receive an email with the form content whenever someone submits your form. To deactive it, just turn it off. You can also delete it anytime.
