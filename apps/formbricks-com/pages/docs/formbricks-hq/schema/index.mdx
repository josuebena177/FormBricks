## What is a schema?

A schema is like a manual for a form: It provides the context of the form including the questions, all answer options, information about pages and more. Essentially, it is the skeleton of your form stored in a .JSON file.

## Why are schemas helpful?

A schema is essential to get a full picture of the data you are collecting. Here is a simple example. Let‚Äôs say you have a form with one question like this:

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Image
    className=""
    src={Question}
    alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
  <div className="mt-2">
    ```json
    <Radio
      name="fav-food"
      label="What's your favorite food?"
      help="Allday, every day!"
      options={["Sushi", "Pasta", "Pizza"]}
    />
    ```
  </div>
</div>

If you POST only the data to an API endpoint, it looks like this:

```json
{
  "submission": {
    "fav-food": "Pasta"
  },
```

If you POST the data along with the schema, it looks like this:

```json
{
  "submission": {
    "fav-food": "pasta"
  },
  "schema": {
    "type": "form",
    "config": {},
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "radio",
        "name": "fav-food",
        "label": "What's your favorite food?",
        "options": ["Sushi", "Pasta", "Pizza"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Without the schema, a visualisation of your data looks like this:

<Image src={NoSchema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />

As you can see, the question and answer options which were not selected are missing. Over time, when more submissions with different values come in, the visualisation will get more complete. However, when respondents can skip this question it will be challenging to make correct statements about this data point.

<Callout title="Inconsistent data" type="warning">
  The lack of a schema almost always leads to **inconsistent data.**
</Callout>

With the schema, the visualisation looks like this:

<Image src={Schema} alt="Open Source Form with Question about favorite food" className="rounded-lg" />

As you can clearly see, this visualisation keeps track of all answer options as well as the initial question. The quality of your decisions will improve, especially over the course of several surveys.

### Why does it work on Typeform, Jotform, etc.?

If you are using standalone form builder like Typeform, Jotform or Tally they handle the schema internally. When you custom build your form functionality or use a Backend-as-a-Service provider like Formspree you should deal with schemas to get a full picture of your data. Or let us do it üëá

### Formbricks React ü§ù Formbricks HQ

Our React Form Library auto-generates a schema out of the form you have built. On submit it sends it over to the Formbricks HQ along with the submission data. Formbricks HQ understands the schema and can display your data correctly.

<Callout title="Forms how they should be" type="note">
  With Formbricks you get the level of integration of a custom-coded solution with the speed and ease of a
  SaaS tool ü§ç

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
