  title: "Form Wrapper - Formbricks React Form Library",
};

The form wrapper is the envelope of you form: you put all important information inside and write on the back what happens with the envelope and its content.

In code terms, this means that it is up to you to decide what happens when the respondent clicks on the Submit button of your form. Formbricks React allows to pass a function to onSubmit which will be executed when the form is submitted.

### Logging to browser console

In this example, weâ€™re handing over the form _data_ and the form _schema_ to the onSubmit function. In the function itself we use the _data_ and the _schema_ and log it in the browser console:

```jsx
onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}
```

### Sending to API endpoint

Here weâ€™re sending the data to an API endpoint to receive and display out submission:

```jsx
<Form
  onSubmit={({ data }) => {
    fetch("API ENDPOINT URL", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
    });
  }}>
  {/* YOUR FORM */}
</Form>
```
