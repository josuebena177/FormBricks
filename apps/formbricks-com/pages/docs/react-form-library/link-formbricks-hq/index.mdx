Creating forms is only half of the work. Dealing with the qualitative data you gather is as time-consuming - at least until we release the Formbricks HQ ðŸ˜‰

<Callout title="No backend needed" type="note">
  In a few weeks, youâ€™ll be able to use Formbricks HQ to receive and manage submissions from any pre-existing
  form. Until then, you can use Formspree.
</Callout>

## Formspree

The closest solution to Formbricks HQ is Formspree. Formspree has a rather limited free plan, but it should be enough to get you started. Once Formbricks HQ is live, youâ€™ll be able to switch within minutes.

### 1. Setup Formspree account & create form

To setup Formspree, go over to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), create an account and create a form:

<Image src={Image1} alt="Formspree open source alternative for free step 1" className="rounded-lg" />

### 2. Copy endpoint URL

Copy endpoint URL out of Formspree dashboard:

<Image
  src={Image2}
  alt="formspree alternative to open source for free and opensource step 2"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

### 3. Update form action

All you have to do now is to set the endpoint URL as the form action (replace ID with your form ID):

```jsx
<Form
  onSubmit={({ data }) => {
    fetch("https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      headers: {
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
    });
  }}>
  {/* YOUR FORM */}
</Form>
```

### 4. Test it

When youâ€™re now filling out your form, you should receive the submissions in your Formspree dashboard.

<Image src={Image3} alt="free alternative to formspree open source step 3" className="rounded-lg" />

### 5. Work with form data

Out of Formspree you can send the submissions to yourself via email (only the email youâ€™re signed up with), forward it to Zapier, etc.

**Remember**: Youâ€™re using the **free plan which includes only 50 submissions / month**, apart from quite a lot of other limitations. For more features please see the [Formspree pricing](https://formspree.io/plans).
