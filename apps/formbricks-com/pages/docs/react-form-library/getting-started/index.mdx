This is a step-by-step guide on how to get started with Formbricks React.

### Preparation: Create React App

To use Formbricks React, you need a React application. If you don't have your application already, please follow these guides to either create a React or a Next.js app:

- [Create new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [Create new Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)

### 1. Install Formbricks React

Install Formbricks React using the package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install -s @formbricks/react
# or
yarn add @formbricks/react
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/react
```

### 2. Create new form component

Since React is based on components, we will create a new component for your form. To do so, create a file called `Form.jsx` - if you work with TypeScript you need to change the suffix to `.tsx`.

### 3. Import form components

To be able to use Formbricks React in your file, you need to import the components that you intend to use. [Here is an overview](/docs/react-form-library/work-with-components) of all available components.

For a simple sign up form we import the following:

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Textarea, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
# or
yarn add @formbricks/react
# or
pnpm add @formbricks/react
```

<Callout title="Import only what you need" type="warning">
  Currently, all components you import will be part of your production build. Please only import components
  that you’re using for the best possible performance.
</Callout>

### 4. Code your form

Now we’re getting to the fun part: Coding your form. This is the full form code you can copy and play around with. Below we go through it step-by-step:

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Textarea, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
import "@formbricks/react/styles.css";

export default function WaitlistForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}>
      <Text name="firstname" label="What's your first name?" validation="required" />
      <Text name="lastname" label="What's your last name?" />
      <Textarea name="about" label="About you" help="Please keep it short" />
      <Submit label="Submit" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

This form imports the default formbricks theme for styling, we cover [styling](/docs/react-form-library/style-css) later.

Your browser window should look like this now:

<Image src={SimpleForm} alt="Unstyled form created with best react form library" className="rounded-lg" />

### 5. Test if it works

To test if the form works as planned open the browser console and fill out the form.

The console should show you the data and the schema of your form:

<Image
  src={LogData}
  alt="Data log of a form created with the fastest react form builder"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

### What’s next?

Congratulations, your React form works!

To get to the desired outcome, there are three more things on your list:

[→ Receive and manage form submissions](/docs/react-form-library/link-formbricks-hq)

[→ Explore all input types and how props define them](/docs/react-form-library/work-with-components)

→ Learn how to style the form with [CSS](/docs/react-form-library/style-css) or [Tailwind](/docs/react-form-library/style-tailwind)

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
