export const meta = {
  title: "Icons - Formbricks React Form Library",
};

Icons give forms and surveys not only a professional look & feel, they increase the usability. Formbricks React supports icons in several locations throughout the form.

### Choosing an icon library

In the first step you have to decide which library you like. We like:

- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/),
- [FeatherIcons](https://feathericons.com/) (beautiful but limited),
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). (huge collection)

### Installing library package

Once you picked yours you have to add it to your repository, e.g. HeroIcons:

```jsx
npm install @heroicons/react
```

### Importing icons

Next you have to import the icons you want to use them in your form:

```jsx
import { PlusIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";

# or several at once

import { ChatBubbleOvalLeftEllipsisIcon, EnvelopeIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/solid";

```

If you paid close attention you noticed that we imported `PlusIcon` from the `outline` folder and the latter two from the `solid` folder. You can find the name of the icon you'd like to import on the respective website:

<Image
  src={FindIcon}
  alt="Illustration of error message and validation handling in best form react lib"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Now you're ready to use them!

### Using icons

At this early stage, we only support icons in the submit button. You add it **before** and **after** the button text.

Before the button text:

```jsx
<Submit label="Submit" PrefixIcon={EnvelopeIcon} />
```

After the button text:

```jsx
<Submit label="Submit" SuffixIcon={PlusIcon} />
```

### Props & Attributes

| Prop       | Type | Default | Description                 |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| PrefixIcon | SVG  | -       | Icon displayed before label |
| SuffixIcon | SVG  | -       | Icon displayed after label  |

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
