  title: "Search Input - Formbricks React Form Library",
};

The `Search` input uses HTML's [native search input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search). It allows a user to enter a search term and is interpreted differently than the normal `text` input from the browser, e.g. it adds a little `x` inside the input field to remove the input again.

Like all other inputs it needs a `name` prop as an unique identifier:

```jsx
<Search name="search" />
```

In most cases, it looks something like this:

```jsx
<Search name="search" placeholder="Search..." label="Search" />
```

### Styling with CSS

You can style your field with adding CSS to the pre-assigned classes. This is how the classes are assigned:

<Image
  src={StyleClasses}
  alt="Data log of a form created with the fastest react form builder"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

| CSS Class           | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| formbricks-form     | The outermost wrapping element.                                                            |
| formbricks-outer    | A wrapper around the label input, help text and error messages.                            |
| formbricks-help     | The help text itself.                                                                      |
| formbricks-wrapper  | A wrapper around the label and the input field (no help text).                             |
| formbricks-label    | The label itself.                                                                          |
| formbricks-inner    | A wrapper around the input element.                                                        |
| formbricks-input    | The input element itself.                                                                  |
| formbricks-message  | The element (or many elements) containing a message â€” often validation and error messages. |
| formbricks-messages | A wrapper around all the messages.                                                         |

### Styling with Tailwind

You can also use Tailwind to extend the classes, like so:

```jsx
<Search
  name="search"
  placeholder="Search..."
  label="Search"
  innerClassName="border-gray-700 border-2 rounded-full"
/>
```

Here are the in-depth guides for [CSS](/docs/react-form-library/style-css) or [Tailwind](/docs/react-form-library/style-tailwind).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
