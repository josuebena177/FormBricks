## Building React forms has never been quicker.

Every developer works with forms, few like their experience. Building Forms, especially in React, can be pretty annoying. State management, validation, form components, accessibility, internationalization and performance are all things you have to deal with, but don't really want to.

We make building - and maintaining - forms easier than ever in the React world.

### Formbricks React Example:

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Textarea, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
import "@formbricks/react/styles.css";

export default function WaitlistForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}>
      <Text name="firstname" label="What's your first name?" validation="required" />
      <Text name="lastname" label="What's your last name?" />
      <Textarea name="about" label="About you" help="Please keep it short" />
      <Submit label="Submit" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Why is this easier already?

- One easy to use syntax for input types including labels, validation and help texts
- HTML & non-HTML input types available out of the box
- Easily maintainable with component-based approach
- All characteristics adjustable via props
- Automatic schema generation

### What is to come?

- Conditional logic
- Multi-page forms
- Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Form Templates

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
