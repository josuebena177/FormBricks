## Building React forms has never been quicker.

Every developer works with forms, few like their experience. Building Forms, especially in React, can be pretty annoying. State management, validation, form components, accessibility, internationalization and performance are all things you have to deal with, but don't really want to.

We make building - and maintaining - forms easier than ever in the React world.

### Formbricks React Example:

```jsx
import { Form, Text, Email, Checkbox, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
import "@formbricks/react/styles.css";

export default function WaitlistForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={({ data, schema }) => console.log("data:", data, "schema:", schema)}>
      <Text name="name" label="What's your name?" validation="required" />
      <Email
        name="email"
        label="What's your email address?"
        placeholder="you@example.com"
        validation="required|email"
      />
      <Checkbox
        name="terms"
        label="Terms & Conditions"
        help="To use our service, please accept."
        validation="accepted"
      />
      <Submit label="Let's go!" />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2">
<Image
  src={StyleClasses}
  alt="Data log of a form created with the fastest react form builder"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

</div>

### Why is this easier already?

- One easy to use syntax for input types including labels, validation and help texts
- HTML & non-HTML input types available out of the box
- Easily maintainable with component-based approach
- All characteristics adjustable via props
- Automatic schema generation

### What is to come?

- Conditional logic
- Multi-page forms
- Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Form Templates

The Formbricks React Library uses [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to benefit from their easy to use data handling and performance optimizations. The easy to use approach was inspired by the [FormKit for Vue.js](https://formkit.com/) Library.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
