  title: "Working with Components - Formbricks React Form Library",
};

We adopt the component-based approach many front-end libraries popularized over the past years. Every element in your form is a dedicated component.

For performance reasons, we do not automatically import all available form components. This is why you have to import components before you can use them, like so:

```jsx
import { Text } from "@formbricks/react";

// or several at once

import { Form, Text, Textarea, Submit } from "@formbricks/react";
```

<Callout title="Only import inputs you use" type="warning">
All imported components will be included in the production build - even when you do not use them in your form. To keep the package size as small as possible only import the components that you need in your form.

</Callout>
