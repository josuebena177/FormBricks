import { Layout } from "@/components/docs/Layout";
import { Callout } from "@/components/shared/Callout";
import Image from "next/image";

export const meta = {
  title: "Submit Button - Formbricks React Form Library",
};

The submit button component is very straight forward:

```jsx
<Submit name="submit" label="Submit" />
```

To keep it working make sure that there is **only one Submit button** per form.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
