import { Layout } from "@/components/docs/Layout";
import { Fence } from "@/components/shared/Fence";
import { Callout } from "@/components/shared/Callout";
import Link from "next/link";

export const meta = {
  title: "Inline surveys",
};

An inline survey is natively embedded into your user interface.

<Callout title="No UI provided" type="warning">
  Since this is highly dependent on your frontend stack, we do not yet provide any UI components. We explain how you can fill a `<div>` in your UI with the Best Practice content.
</Callout>

## Preparation

The Best Practices come with a default pop-over in the script. We assume that you have already installed one of the Best Practices and configured it. If not, please proceed here:

- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/feedback-box">Install and configure Feedback Box</Link>
- <Link href="/docs/best-practices/pmf-survey">Install and configure Product-Market Fit survey</Link>

## Implementation

1. To inject the Best Practice in your inline div, you have to make sure to have set the `containerID` in the config object:

```json
config: {
  formbricksUrl: "https://app.formbricks.com",
  formId: "cldipcgat0000mn0g31a8pdse",
  containerId: "formbricks-survey", // needs to be set
},
```

2. All you have to do then is to set the `id` of your div accordingly:

```tsx
<div id="formbricks-survey"></div>
```

At the moment we only support embedding one survey per page. We are working on a solution to support multiple surveys per page.

## Full Example

Here is a full example file for React.js using NPM:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

export function FeedbackButton() {
  useEffect(() => {
    window.formbricks = {
      ...window.formbricks,
      config: {
        hqUrl: "https://app.formbricks.com",
        formId: "abcdefg",
        containerId: "formbricks-container",
        contact: {
          name: "Matti",
          position: "Co-Founder",
          imgUrl: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/675065?s=128&v=4",
        },
      },
    };
    // @ts-ignore
    import("@formbricks/feedback");
  }, []);

  return <div id="formbricks-container"></div>;
}
```

## That's it ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™re Best Practice survey will be displayed in your target div when the Best Practice survey is fully loaded.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
