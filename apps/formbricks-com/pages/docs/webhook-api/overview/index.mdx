Formbricks' Webhook API offers a powerful interface for interacting with webhooks. Webhooks in Formbricks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications of changes to specific objects in the Formbricks environment.

Our API has several REST endpoints enabling you to manage these webhooks, providing a great deal of flexibility:

1. **List Webhooks:** Retrieve a list of all existing webhooks.
2. **Create a New Webhook:** Add a new webhook to your system.
3. **Get a Specific Webhook:** Query the details of a specific webhook using its unique ID.
4. **Delete a Webhook:** Remove an existing webhook.

These APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration of Formbricks with third-party systems. By making use of our webhook API, you can automate the process of sending data to these systems whenever significant events occur within your Formbricks environment.
