Formbricks is available Open-Source under AGPLv3 license. You can host Formbricks on your own servers without a subscription. Check out our [docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/deployment) to see how to self-host Formbricks.

We also have a hosted cloud offering with a generous free plan to get you up and running as quickly as possible. For more information, please visit [formbricks.com](https://formbricks.com)
