## Cloud vs. self-hosted

Formbricks is available Open-Source under a permissive MIT license. You can host Formbricks on your own servers without a subscription. Check out our [docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/formbricks-hq/self-hosting) to see how to self-host Formbricks.
We will soon offer a cloud version of Formbricks which saves you the hassle of maintaining your own servers. We will update this Readme once the cloud version is available.

(In the future we may develop additional features that aren't in the free Open-Source version)
